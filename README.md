# Growth-Journey: High School

This repository contains projects I created during high school. These works demonstrate my deeper exploration into programming, design, and 3D modeling.

## Projects Included
1. **Sorting Algorithm in Java (`sorting_algorithm_java`)**
   - Implemented sorting algorithms like bubble sort and merge sort in Java.
   - Learned algorithm optimization and debugging.

2. **Advanced Animation (`advanced_animation.mp4`)**
   - Created a short animation using advanced techniques and editing software.
   - Explored timing, transitions, and visual effects.

3. **3D Model Project (`3d_model_project.blend`)**
   - Designed and rendered a 3D model using Blender.
   - Gained experience in 3D design and rendering workflows.

## Lessons Learned
- Deepened my understanding of algorithms and programming.
- Explored 3D modeling and animation as a creative medium.
- Strengthened problem-solving and project management skills.
